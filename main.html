    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the measure of the amount of time it takes for an algorithm to run, given the size of the input. It's a crucial concept in computer science and helps us assess how efficient an algorithm is. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, as they can perform their tasks with minimal time requirements.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity is a measure of the amount of memory space an algorithm needs to run, again in relation to the input size. It is often represented using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> is important to ensure that an algorithm doesn't use more memory than is available, especially in constrained environments.</p>
